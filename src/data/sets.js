        answer:
          '1. eval ( ) : passing in a string like "var a = 3" will modify the lexical scope of where the eval statement is at runtime. 2. with ( ) : this statement takes an object, which has zero or more properties and threats that object as if it is a wholly separate lexical scope, and thus the object\'s properties are treated as lexically defined in that scope.',

Without a name, the function needs to refer to itself for recursion which requires the deprecated "arguments.callee" reference. 3. Without a name it is difficult to determine the purpose of the function.',
